One-Page Navigation
===================

The One-Page Navigation module enhances one-page sites by adding smooth
scrolling (when you click a hash/fragment link (`example.com/#about`), the page
will scroll smoothly up/down to bring the linked element into view) and smart
navigation (as you scroll up/down the page, hash/fragment links become active as
each linked element comes into view).

You will need to create your own hash/fragment links, and link them to elements
on the page. Then tell One-Page Navigation which element holds your links and
it'll do the rest!
